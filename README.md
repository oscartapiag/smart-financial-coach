## üìå Problem Statement  

Managing personal finances is overwhelming. Manual tracking is tedious, and generic budgeting apps fail to drive behavior change. Users often:  

- Lack **visibility** into where their money is going.  
- Miss opportunities to save or cut expenses.  
- Overlook recurring subscriptions or ‚Äúgray charges.‚Äù  
- Feel anxious about long-term financial stability.  

The **Smart Financial Coach** addresses these pain points by leveraging AI + heuristics to **analyze spending, forecast goals, and suggest concrete, non-judgmental actions**.

## ‚ú® Features  

### 1. **Transaction Upload & Analysis**  
- Upload a CSV of transactions.  
- Automatic parsing with Pandas ‚Üí clean DataFrame.  
- Categorization via lightweight ML (k-NN, text vectorization) + heuristics.  
- Charts: bar, pie, stacked by month.  

### 2. **Intelligent Spending Insights**  
- Detect top spending categories.  
- Identify anomalies (‚Äúspike in rideshare this month‚Äù).  
- Friendly insights (‚Äú$120 spent on coffee; brewing at home could save $1,000/year‚Äù).  

### 3. **Savings Goal Calculator & Forecasting**  
- Input: target amount + timeframe.  
- Forecast progress based on current income/expenses.  
- If off-track, system suggests **3 biggest cut levers** (randomized 15‚Äì35% reductions to simulate behavior change).  
- Output: projected savings curve with/without cuts.  

### 4. **Subscription & Gray Charge Detector**  
- Scans for recurring transactions by merchant + cadence.  
- Flags forgotten free trials, duplicate services, small unnoticed charges.  
- Displays as a clean, filterable list with monthly totals.  
- Automatically finds websites for some subscriptions to easily manage them.

### 5. **Net Worth Calculator & Projections**  
- Computes baseline net worth from assets, debts, and income.  
- Projects future net worth based on spending cuts and investment strategy.  
- Visualized as a time-series chart.  
- Suggests changes on how to increase net worth and visually allows you to see how those changes will affect your net worth.

###üîí Responsible AI & Privacy

No sensitive data stored: all uploads processed in-memory only.

User override: categories can be re-labeled if AI confidence is low.

Transparency: projections show assumptions and ranges.

Behavioral Change: concrete, non-judgmental suggestions to reduce spend.

Financial Visibility: clean dashboards (insights, subscriptions, goals, projections).

Trust & Security: private, demo-only, with disclaimers.

AI Application: ML for categorization + anomaly detection, forecasting heuristics.

üìà Future Enhancements

Direct bank integrations (Plaid, Chase API).

Multi-account merging.

Monte Carlo net worth simulation.

Mobile app interface (React Native).

Advanced explainable AI models for categorization & forecasting.
